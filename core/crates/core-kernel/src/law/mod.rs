//! G: the law of tendencies, a pure evidence count (v2.0 §5; P5-23).
//!
//! (R, b, σ̂, evidence groups in H order; 𝔏_v) → R′ and staged L entries.
//! G reads evidence and the statistics derived from it (b, σ̂ and the competing
//! tendencies' π); it never reads x, m, the gains g or the recovery rates λ
//! (LP8, I10). No clock, randomness, storage, network or model access.
//!
//! The canonical calculation order and the readings this card fixes are in
//! `docs/traceability/P5-23.md` §1 (D1–D11) and the difference register
//! V2-38 to V2-48. Parts that need the R fields missing from the IDL (V2-48)
//! are not implemented yet (`reports/P5-23/BLOCKED.md`).
